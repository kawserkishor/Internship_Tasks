## Task 2 â€“ Information Gathering using Maltego

We used Maltego to analyze the website `testphp.vulnweb.com` by running various transforms on the Website entity. These transforms revealed:

- The domain `testphp.vulnweb.com` resolves to an IP address hosted by Acunetix (expected, as it's a test site).
- WHOIS data showed sample registration metadata.
- Additional DNS names and metadata were explored.

The investigation simulated a real-world recon step where an attacker visualizes target infrastructure, hosting, ownership, and related digital assets.
